MCP Hackathon Repository

User submits a class note, github repo, textbook snippet, or topic name (e.g., “Photosynthesis” or “Lagrangian Mechanics”). A team of agents processes this to:

•	Summarize the material
•	Expand it with external context
•	Generate practice questions
•	Evaluate user answers and correct misconceptions

This is a *self-paced* AI tutor powered by a collaborative agent system.

Possible Agents:

SummarizerAgent: Condenses raw text into structured summaries
ContextAgent: Enriches summary with external sources (Wikipedia, arXiv, mock APIs)
QuestionAgent: Creates practice questions (MCQ, short answer, true/false)
CheckerAgent: Evaluates user responses and provides corrections
ExplainerAgent: Gives extra help, analogies, or diagrams to aid understanding
ProgressAgent: Tracks what the user has mastered and suggests next topics
